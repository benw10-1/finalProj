# Overview 
Fast & easy customizable forms for any situation. Whether you want to create a grocery list for your next party, draft interview questions, surveys, or a travel bucket list, YourForms.App has you covered. Built with React and MUI, this app offers clean and accessible UX that allows users to create an account and publish all of their forms in one, organized place. 

Offering a published link right from the dashboard allows users a quick and easy way to share their forms with anyone they want (a feature that Google Forms does not have). Integrated with PayPal API, users can pay for premium features such as unlimited form hosting capacity.
